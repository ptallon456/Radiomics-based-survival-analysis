# Radiomics-based-survival-analysis
## Overview
Radioimcs is a promising field with the ability to provide new analytical tools to clinicians. This project examines the ability of dimensionally reduced radiomic features to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk patients using a Cox Proportional Hazards Model. The results shows how low-rank radiomic features can be used to assess patient prognosis. Radiomic features were obtained using the pyRadiomics library to identify features based on first-order statistics and tumor morphology. The data was initially reduced using principal component analysis. The principal components were further reduced using t-SNE. Ability of t-SNE features to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk patients is shown using a Kaplan-Meier Curve.
